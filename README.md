Examples and notes for Mark and Rémi's talks at Stay Curious Café on May, 5th 2021.

## Session 1: A Single Email

Looking at how a single email can purposefully render differently across email platforms, showing we’re not stuck in the 90’s anymore.

## Session 2: Experimental Email

Looking at how we can push email clients to their limits creating visual artworks and playable games. 

### Pixel Art and CSS Art (in emails)

#### Images Off Pixel Art

* [LEGO City Undercover Email](https://useparcel.com/e/9b41a78a-cbdd-45e7-92fb-f0757447b8f4) ([Gist mirror](https://gist.github.com/hteumeuleu/3818eded96f066d7b48a83c732c89156))
* Great trend in HTML emails until responsive came along. WebKit and Blink rendering makes this kind of slicing hideous with thin lines everywhere.
